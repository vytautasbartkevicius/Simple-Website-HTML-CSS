# Simple-Website-HTML-CSS
Simple website about rock band- merchandise, ticket store, about pages without functionality just html and css. 
I created this website as I was learning html and css I just added couple of things every now and then. It is nice looking website but it does not have any good functions
it is without php or javascript. You can find project with php and nice function in another repository. This website has 3 pages index, store and about
